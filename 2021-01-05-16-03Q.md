# "to be careful not to let your career become a “disordered affection” that prevents you from being free to meet new people, spending time with those you love, and viewing people as ends rather than means. It’s an “affection” since it’s something that appeals to you. It’s “disordered” because it’s not ordered toward something life-giving." (from "The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything: A Spirituality for Real Life" by James Martin)
