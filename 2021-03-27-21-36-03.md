I thought of you when I read this quote from "The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything: A Spirituality for Real Life" by James Martin -

"Naming our desires tells us something about who we are. In the hospital I learned something about myself, which helped free me of doubts about what I wanted to do. And who I wanted to be. It’s freeing to say, “This is what I desire in life.” Naming our desires may also make us more grateful when we finally receive the fulfillment of our hopes."
