# "For the Jesuit, if the Exercises are about how to live your own life, the Constitutions are about how to live your life with others. The Exercises are about you and God; the Constitutions, at least for Jesuits, are about you, God, and your brother Jesuits." (from "The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything: A Spirituality for Real Life" by James Martin)
