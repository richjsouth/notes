# "The Exercises follows a careful plan, which is based on the path of spiritual progress that Ignatius noted in himself and, later, in others. The First Week looks at gratitude for God’s gifts in your life and, then, at your own sinfulness. Sometimes a deep sin is revealed, like selfishness. In the end, you are usually led to realize that you are a sinner (or a flawed human being) who is still loved by God. The Second Week is a series of meditations taken directly from the New Testament, focusing on the birth, young adult life, and eventual ministry of Jesus of Nazareth. Here you follow Jesus in his preaching, healings, and nature miracles, which bring you in contact, in an imaginative way, with Jesus in his earthly ministry. The Third Week focuses on the Passion: Jesus’ final entry into Jerusalem, the Last Supper, his trial, crucifixion, suffering on the cross, and death. The Fourth Week is based on the Gospel accounts of the Resurrection and, once again, God’s love for you. Along the way, like mileposts, Ignatius includes specific meditations on ideas like humility, decision making, and choosing between good and evil."
