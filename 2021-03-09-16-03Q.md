# How to Read More: 8 Reasons and 7 Strategies to Read More Books - RyanHoliday.net

> ## Excerpt
> I probably get asked this question more than any other: How do you read so much? I don’t think the question is really about me. I’m an author. It’s my job to read a lot. I think what people are really asking is how they can read more. Because as wonderful as reading is, in a busy, distracting world, it’s hard to find the time. Or rather, it’s hard to make the time.  So when people ask: How can I read more? How can I read more books this year?  What’s the secret to reading a lot?  The short answer is just do it.  (Nobody asks, “How do you find the time to eat?”) But obviously you know that. What it’s really about, then, is finding the motivation, finding the justification, and building a reading practice that will help you do what you already want to do. Below are some strategies, from my life and from history—because people have always struggled to read in a distracted world—that will help you become a power reader.  8 Reasons to Read More Reading Is Your Moral Duty Reading Is the Way to Tell the Future Reading Prevents You From Being Functionally Illiterate Reading Makes You an Informed Citizen Reading Softens Your Solitude Reading Can Solve Your Problems Reading Is a Conversation With the Wisest to Ever Live All Leaders Are Readers  7 Strategies To Read More Read First Thing in the Morning Read a Page a Day Read While You Eat Read While You Relax Keep a Commonplace Book Read the Masters Again and Again Realize: You Are Not Too Busy 8 Reasons to Read More Reading Is Your Moral Duty  As a young boy, the famed basketball coach George Raveling learned an invaluable lesson about the power of both knowledge and ignorance from his grandmother, who raised him.  “Why did the slave masters hide their money in books, George?” she asked the young boy, standing together in her kitchen. “I don’t know, grandma,” he said. “Because they knew the slaves wouldn’t open them,” she said. There’s a reason it was illegal to teach slaves to read. There is a reason that every totalitarian regime has burned and banned books. Knowledge is power. It sounds like a cliché, but clichés only sound that way because of the generally accepted truth at their core. What is less of a cliché, but actually more true, is the converse of that idea: A lack of knowledge is weakness—it engenders supplication and makes resistance harder.  From this early lesson, George Raveling came to see reading as a moral duty. To not read, to remain in ignorance, was not only to be weak—it was to ignore the people who had fought so hard, who had struggled at such great cost to read and to provide for future generations the right and the ability to do so. It was to spit in the face of Frederick Douglass, of Booker T. Washington, and, of course, of Martin Luther King, Jr. who Raveling had gotten to know.  It is worth pointing out today that money is still hidden in the pages of books—though not because someone put it there in order to keep it from you. Think about how many people want to get better at something, anything, everything. Look at how many people are desperate to be successful, or to extricate themselves from this cycle of mediocrity that has trapped so many of our generation. These people look everywhere for the solution to their problems. They seek out secret formulas, shortcuts, gurus. They will turn their entire world upside down before they stop and look at the one place where you can always be sure to find answers—the book shelf.  We read because it makes us powerful. When we don’t read, we become weak—easy to manipulate, less than what we are capable of being. It’s in our self-interest to read (there’s money in it), but it’s also our moral duty.  Reading Is the Way to Tell the Future Let’s imagine a scenario in which almost all our modern scholarship was lost. Imagine if some great fire at the Library of Alexandria wiped away the last few hundred years of breakthroughs in psychology and biology. Suddenly, countless research papers and books and discoveries were turned to ash. The cost would be immense, no question. And yet, somehow, we’d be fine. Even if all that remained were just the writings of Marcus Aurelius and Seneca and Epictetus. Because as much as our species craves newness, the truth is that most truths are very old. In fact, it’s these timeless truths that teach us more about the future and about our current times than most of our contemporary thinking.  As Douglas MacArthur wrote in the early 20th century, speculating about the future of warfare, the best lessons about what’s coming next come not from the recent but from the distant past. “Were the accounts of all battles, save only those of Genghis Khan,” he said, “effaced from the pages of history, and were all the facts of his campaigns preserved in descriptive detail, the soldier would still possess a mine of untold wealth from which to extract nuggets of knowledge useful in molding an army for future use.“ Of course, one should always avail themselves of the latest research and the newest books. The problem is that, for far too many people, this comes at the expense of availing themselves of wisdom from the wisest minds who ever lived.  The Stoics say over and over that it is inexcusable not to learn from the past. As Marcus Aurelius wrote in his diary at some point during the Antonine Plague, the future is the past repeated. “Look at the past,” he says in Meditations, “and from that, extrapolate the future: the same thing. No escape from the rhythm of events.” It is from this learning, from the learning of the distant past, from the wisest minds who ever lived, that we can know [...]
