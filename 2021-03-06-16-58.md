# How can you be honest with God in prayer? The easiest way may be to imagine God in front of you. You might picture God or Jesus sitting across from you in a chair, sitting beside you on a couch or whatever feels comfortable. Then just speak in a familiar way, in silence or out loud, about your life.

# God already knows what is going on in your life. Still, your openness and intentional sharing are an important part of the spiritual life. Once again, comparing it to a human friendship is instructive. Let’s say your father has died. Good friends already know how sad you are and probably don’t need to be told the extent of your loss. But you tell them anyway, right? And they listen.
