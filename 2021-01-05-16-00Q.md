# "The Italian Jesuits have a saying, “Tre gesuiti, quattro opinioni!” Three Jesuits, four opinions! But there’s one question that would elicit a similar answer from those five hypothetical Jesuits. If asked to define Ignatian spirituality, the first thing out of their mouths would most likely be finding God in all things." (from "The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything: A Spirituality for Real Life" by James Martin)
