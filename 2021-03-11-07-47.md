I me thought of you when I read this quote from "The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything: A Spirituality for Real Life" by James Martin -

*"Experiencing God also comes through personal interactions within the community. Sure, God communicates through private, intimate moments—as in prayer or reading of sacred texts— but God also enters into relationships with us through others in a faith community. Finding God often happens in the midst of a community—with a “we” as often as an “I.” For many people this community is a church, a synagogue, or a mosque. Or more broadly, religion."
