# A few years ago, I told my spiritual director that I was so angry at God that I used an obscenity in prayer. I was so frustrated that God didn’t seem to be doing anything to help me that, one night, I clenched my fists and shouted aloud, “How about some @#$% help, God!” Some readers might be shocked that a priest would use language like that, especially in prayer.

# I thought my spiritual director, a wise and gentle Jesuit priest named Damian, would reproach me. Instead he said, “That’s a good prayer!” I thought Damian was kidding. But he continued, “That’s a good prayer because it’s honest. God wants your honesty, Jim.”
